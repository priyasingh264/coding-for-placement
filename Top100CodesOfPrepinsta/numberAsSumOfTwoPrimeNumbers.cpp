/*

Program to check whether a number be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers
Prime number is a number which only have two divisors i.e. a number which can not be divided by any other number other than 1 or itself is a prime number.

There are many theories which express numbers as a sum of two primes like Goldbachâ€™s Conjecture which states that any even number greater than 2 can be expressed as a sum of two primes.

Here we will check for all the numbers if they can be expressed as sum of two primes or not.
